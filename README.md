Anchorage Programming Workshop Code of Conduct
=====================

This is a "fork" of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee guides, adapted for use in
Anchorage tech events. We have also included text from [the Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Event_Guidelines).

We hope that, as a community, we can iterate and improve continually.
