Alaska Hackathon Code of Conduct
=====================

This is a "fork" of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee guides, adapted for use in
Anchorage tech events. We have also included text from [the Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Event_Guidelines) and the [Wikimedia Foundation](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Friendly_space_policy).

We hope that, as a community, we can iterate and improve continually.
